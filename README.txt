Project I came up with to practice my html, css and javascript skills. I improved my css by custom designing and animating the cards.

This project developed my code planning and organization skills as well as my logical thinking.
  -I broke the project into components of design and each functionality
  -I planned how to represent and store the information and display of the cards.
